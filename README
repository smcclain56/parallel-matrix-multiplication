[INTRODUCTION]

Homework 5 is a matrix multiplication program that compares the speed up for a sequential vs multithreaded calculation

[CONTENTS]

Homework 4 contains several files:

	* matrixMult.c, which contains functions that relate to manipulation of the matrices; initMatrix(), initResult(), compareMatrix(), printMatrix(), seqMult() and parallelMult(). 
	* rtclock.c, which contains functions used for timing the code
	* main.c which interacts with the user. Accepts either sequential or parallel mode and calculates time depending on input.
	* This README.

[USE]

	* Run the `make` command in console to compile the full program.
	* Run ./mmm P N size to run a parallel matrix multiplication with N threads on a matrix with size size.
		-Must input number of threads
	* Run ./mmm S size to run a sequential matrix multiplication on a square matrix of size size. 
	* Run make clean to clear executables
